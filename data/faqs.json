            "answer": "Many clients book months in advance but if you can only book a few weeks in advance we'll always try to accommodate you if we have space. That said, you should book as far in advance as possible, especially for busier periods such as weekends, school holidays, and special dates such as Christmas and New Year."

            "answer": "Yes, all new bookings must have a trial stay to make sure your dog is a good fit for Lau's Paws. We can then arrange a daytime or overnight trial stay on a date that's convenient for both parties. Standard rates apply and are non-refundable."
